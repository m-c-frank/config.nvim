i need a way to easily link to other markdown files without knowing the exact filepath or title. imagine i am running on a linux machine and want the most minimal approach. if necessary write the most minimal nvim plugin. so when i type leader lm in normal mode it should trigger the file search and update the list of proposed results with each typed character. i want my typed text to be the displayed text and the path to the file the actual link. i think we can do it like obsidian with the | character. what do you thing okay use telescope instead and just take the text that the user has input as the plain text of the link and the selected path as the actual link
something like that but also define the base path as a configurable and give it to me as a readme with the directory tree of a nvim plugin that is hosted at github.com/m-c-frank/linkmarkdown. do it directly in my nvim/lua/custom/plugins directory of my .config and with kickstart fork

To achieve the functionality you've described, we'll outline a solution that involves creating a minimal Neovim plugin using Telescope for file searching, allowing you to insert Markdown links without knowing the exact filepath or title. This plugin will let you trigger a file search with leader + lm, update search results as you type, and insert a Markdown link where the displayed text is what you've typed and the actual link is the path to the selected file, similar to Obsidian's linking style but using Telescope and Neovim's capabilities.

Directory Structure
The directory tree for the Neovim plugin hosted at github.com/m-c-frank/linkmarkdown will look like this:

                └── link_markdown.lua
Plugin Development
link_markdown.lua: This Lua file will contain the core logic for the plugin.

Plugin Code (link_markdown.lua)
Here's a basic implementation of the plugin using Telescope for file searching:

lua
Copy code
local M = {}
local telescope = require('telescope.builtin')
local action_state = require('telescope.actions.state')

function M.search_insert_link()
  local opts = {}
  -- Define the base path as configurable
  opts.cwd = vim.g.linkmarkdown_base_path or vim.loop.cwd()

  telescope.find_files({
    prompt_title = "Insert Markdown Link",
    cwd = opts.cwd,

    attach_mappings = function(prompt_bufnr, map)
      local insert_link = function()
        local selection = action_state.get_selected_entry()
        local link_text = action_state.get_current_line()
        local link_path = selection.path
        local markdown_link = string.format("[%s](%s)", link_text, link_path)
        vim.api.nvim_put({markdown_link}, '', true, true)
        vim.cmd('stopinsert')
      end

      map('i', '<CR>', insert_link)
      map('n', '<CR>', insert_link)
      return true
    end
  })

# LinkMarkdown

A minimal Neovim plugin for easily linking to other Markdown files using Telescope.

## Installation

Using vim-plug:

```vim
Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
Plug 'm-c-frank/linkmarkdown', { 'do': ':lua require("custom.plugins.linkmarkdown").setup()' }
Setup
In your init.vim or Neovim configuration Lua file:

lua
Copy code
vim.g.linkmarkdown_base_path = "/your/base/path"
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>lm', ':lua require("custom.plugins.linkmarkdown").search_insert_link()<CR>', {noremap = true, silent = true})
Replace /your/base/path with the base directory you wish to search within.

Usage
Press <leader>lm in Normal mode to trigger the file search. Type your search query; the list of files will update with each character typed. Press Enter to insert a Markdown link at the cursor position, where the link text is what you've typed, and the actual link is the path to the selected file.

  end
}
Replace 'm-c-frank/linkmarkdown' with the path to the local clone of this plugin if it's not hosted on a public repository.

Plugin Setup
After installing the plugin, you need to configure it in your init.lua. Here's how to set the base path and key mappings:

lua
Copy code
-- Set the base path for file searches (change "/your/base/path" to your desired path)
vim.g.linkmarkdown_base_path = "/your/base/path"

-- Key mapping for triggering the search and link insertion
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>lm', ':lua require("custom.plugins.linkmarkdown").search_insert_link()<CR>', {noremap = true, silent = true})
Plugin Source Code
Below is the entire source code for the plugin. You can place this in a file named link_markdown.lua inside your Neovim configuration directory (e.g., .config/nvim/lua/custom/plugins/linkmarkdown/).

lua
Copy code
local M = {}
local telescope = require('telescope.builtin')
local action_state = require('telescope.actions.state')

function M.search_insert_link()
  local opts = {}
  opts.cwd = vim.g.linkmarkdown_base_path or vim.loop.cwd()

  telescope.find_files({
    prompt_title = "Insert Markdown Link",
    cwd = opts.cwd,
    attach_mappings = function(prompt_bufnr, map)
      local insert_link = function()
        local selection = action_state.get_selected_entry()
        local link_text = action_state.get_current_line()
        local link_path = selection.path
        local markdown_link = string.format("[%s](%s)", link_text, link_path)
        vim.api.nvim_put({markdown_link}, '', true, true)
        vim.cmd('stopinsert')
      end

      map('i', '<CR>', insert_link)
      map('n', '<CR>', insert_link)
      return true
    end
  })
end

return M
Usage
With the plugin installed and configured:

Navigate to where you want to insert a Markdown link in your document.
Press <leader>lm in Normal mode. This will open Telescope's file search within the base path you've set.
Start typing to filter the list of files. The list will update with each character you type.
Select the file you want to link to and press Enter. A Markdown link will be inserted at your cursor position, using the text you've typed as the link text and the file path as the link target.
Customization
You can change the base path and the key mapping as needed by modifying the settings in your init.lua.

For further customization or issues, please refer to the plugin's documentation and the Telescope documentation.

# LinkMarkdown Plugin for Neovim

The LinkMarkdown plugin integrates with Telescope to provide an easy way to insert Markdown links into your documents, without needing to remember or type out the full paths to the files you're linking to. It's designed to enhance your Markdown workflow in Neovim by allowing you to quickly link files using a searchable interface.

## Features

- Use Telescope to search for files within a specified base path.
- Insert Markdown links with customizable display text and the selected file's relative path as the link target.

## Requirements

- Neovim (version 0.5 or newer)
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) plugin

## Installation

### Using packer.nvim

If you're using `packer.nvim` as your plugin manager, add the following lines to your Neovim configuration:

```lua
use {
    'your_username/linkmarkdown', -- Replace 'your_username' with your actual GitHub username if you fork the repository.
    requires = { {'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'} },
    config = function()
        require('link_markdown').setup()
    end
}
Ensure you have Telescope installed as a dependency.

Setup and Configuration
After installing the plugin, you'll need to set it up in your Neovim configuration. Here is how you can do it in your init.lua file:

Define the Base Path (optional):
lua
Copy code
-- Set the base path for file searches. If not set, the plugin uses the current working directory.
vim.g.linkmarkdown_base_path = "/path/to/your/markdown/files"
Set Key Bindings:
lua
Copy code
-- Key mapping to trigger the file search and insert the Markdown link
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>lm', '<cmd>lua require("link_markdown").search_insert_link()<CR>', {noremap = true, silent = true})
Plugin Source Code
Below is the source code for link_markdown.lua. You should place this Lua script inside a suitable directory within your Neovim configuration, such as ~/.config/nvim/lua/link_markdown.lua:

lua
Copy code
local M = {}
local telescope = require('telescope.builtin')
local action_state = require('telescope.actions.state')

function M.search_insert_link()
    local opts = {}
    opts.cwd = vim.g.linkmarkdown_base_path or vim.loop.cwd()

    telescope.find_files({
        prompt_title = "Insert Markdown Link",
        cwd = opts.cwd,
        attach_mappings = function(prompt_bufnr, map)
            local insert_link = function()
                local selection = action_state.get_selected_entry()
                local link_text = action_state.get_current_line()
                local relative_path = vim.fn.fnamemodify(selection.path, ":.")
                local markdown_link = string.format("[%s](%s)", link_text, relative_path)
                vim.api.nvim_put({markdown_link}, 'c', true, true)
                vim.cmd('stopinsert')
            end

            map('i', '<CR>', insert_link)
            map('n', '<CR>', insert_link)
            return true
        end
    })
end

return M
